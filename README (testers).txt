1. The "Images for Testing" folder stores sample images of various sizes, including the default image used on the website.

2. The passwords have not been hashed due to testing on the server. In a real-world scenario, hashing will be implemented for security purposes.

3. The deletion status in the database table "contacts" is used for testing purposes to facilitate the rollback of any data without needing to re-enter values.
